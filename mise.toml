# We use ubi for nearly everything we can for two reasons. One is consistency. This way we don't
# have two developers who compile a Go package with different Go versions. The other is that it's
# the fastest way to install these packages. In many cases, these tools are available in the mise
# registry with multiple backends, so spelling out "ubi:..." ensures we use the ubi backend.
