# Copied from mongosync/evergreen, with mongosync added as a module.

# The file tree looks like this:
# src
#  |---- resmoke
#  |---- migration-verifier
#  |---- mongosync

# The modules used for performance testing and the migration-verifier are pinned to arbitrary commits.
# It's okay to update the pins whenever we feel like it as long as tests pass.

  # TODO (REP-3977): This is used for the JS unit tests, which load JS code from the mongo repo's
  # `jstests` dir. The exact revision doesn't matter too much, but once we fully generate the
  # Evergreen config, we should use one of the pinned revisions we use for cases where we need
  # something from the mongo repo.

  # Passthrough testing of mongodump+mongorestore uses various code in the mongosync repo:
  #
  #   - resmoke JS test code with slight tweaks
  #   - resmoke python code with DumpRestoreFixture
  #   - Go source code for mongodump-suite-gen
  #   - Go source code for mongodump-task-gen
  #
  # We use git.get_project to load the mongosync as a module when necessary
